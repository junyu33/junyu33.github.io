<h1>Conceptual Logic Transformation Rules — Week 5~8</h1>
<p>Key Focus — <strong>Relationship</strong></p>
<p>1.*</p>
<h3 id="S-S">S-S</h3>
<img src="https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/1.png">
<img src="https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/2.png">
<p>The primary key serves as a foreign key.</p>
<p>The primary key of 1 is migrated to n.</p>
<h4 id="With-Attributes">With Attributes</h4>
<p><strong>If there are attributes, remove the attributes, swap the cardinalities, and then follow the above rules.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note when modeling the conceptual model: First draw the 1* in the conceptual model.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="S-W">S-W</h3>
<img src="https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/3.png">
<p>A weak entity does not have a primary key and cannot be moved to a strong entity.</p>
<img src="https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/4.png">
<blockquote>
<p>1:* Binary S——W<br>
1——&gt;* Primary key——&gt;Primary key + Foreign key</p>
<p>from our teacher</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="With-Attributes-2">With Attributes</h4>
<img src="https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/5.png">
<p>The parentheses indicate that &quot;preference&quot; is a weak entity.</p>
<p><strong>At this point, an error occurs when generating the logical model</strong></p>
<img src="https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/6.png">
<p>Move the attributes of the relationship into the dependent weak entity.</p>
<p>(Here, Relationship_2 should be &quot;state,&quot; and the &quot;state&quot; item in &quot;preference&quot; should be the &quot;Date&quot; item.)</p>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/7.png'>
<p>Then proceed with the transformation according to the previous rule.</p>
<h2 id="1-1">1.1</h2>
<h3 id="S-S-2">S-S</h3>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/8.png'>
<p>If both parties are forced to participate, an alert will be triggered. Depending on the business requirements, one side can be changed to 0-1.</p>
<img src="https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/9.jpg">
<p>The dominated side will have the foreign key of the dominating side.</p>
<p>To move the foreign key to the right side, the right side should be set to 0-1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, for 1-1 and 0-1 relationships, it is equivalent to setting the left side as the dominating side.</p>
</blockquote>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/a.jpg'>
<p>For cases where both sides are 0-1, the dominated object is the side with fewer entities.</p>
<h3 id="S-W-2">S-W</h3>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/b.png'>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/c.jpg'>
<p>A weak entity uses the strong entity as its primary key and foreign key.</p>
<p>Mandatory participation on both sides will trigger an alert. There are two ways to resolve this: either change the dominated side to 0-1, or directly merge the weak entity with the strong entity.</p>
<h3 id="With-Attributes-3">With Attributes</h3>
<h4 id="1-1-0-1">1-1, 0-1:</h4>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/d.png'>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/e.jpg'>
<p>At this point, a new bidirectional relationship warning may appear. Handle it using the method for cases without attributes.</p>
<p>We merge Manages and Staff. The dominant entity is Branch (diagram omitted), resulting in the physical model:</p>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/f.png'>
<h4 id="1-1-1-1">1-1, 1-1:</h4>
<p>Bidirectional association constraints. Modify it to 1-1, 0-1, which is equivalent to the handling method for this scenario.</p>
<h4 id="0-1-0-1">0-1, 0-1:</h4>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/10.jpg'>
<p>Merge the side that is closer to 1-1 (with fewer entities) with the new entity, and treat the original entity as the dominant one.</p>
<p><em>.</em></p>
<h3 id="Strong-Entity-Without-Attributes">Strong Entity Without Attributes</h3>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/11.png'>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/12.jpg'>
<blockquote>
<p>A <em>:</em> relationship becomes two 1:* relationships.</p>
<p>A new entity is generated—a weak entity.</p>
<p>The primary keys of the original entities on both sides → become part of the new entity: primary key + foreign key (the primary key from the &quot;1&quot; side moves to the &quot;n&quot; side and becomes a foreign key).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Strong-Entity-with-Attributes">Strong Entity with Attributes</h3>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/13.png'>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/14.png'>
<p>Compared to having no attributes, it includes attributes of the association itself, but otherwise there is no significant difference.</p>
<h3 id="Unable-to-Set-Up-S-W">Unable to Set Up S-W.</h3>
<p>Solutions to resolve the warning:</p>
<ol>
<li>If there are no attributes, change one of the * to 1.</li>
<li>If there are attributes, merge one relationship with the weak entity to form a 1.* relationship.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Recursion">Recursion</h2>
<h3 id="1">1.*</h3>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/15.png'>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/16.png'>
<p>The logical model includes the foreign key of the entity itself, which can also be interpreted as moving from one to many.</p>
<p>0-1, 1-* is acceptable. 0-1, 0-* is acceptable.</p>
<p><em><em>1-1, 1-</em> will result in a reflexive mandatory warning.</em>*</p>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/19.png'>
<h3 id="1-1-2">1.1</h3>
<p>Pay attention to setting the dominant role; the remaining rules are the same as in 1.*.</p>
<p><strong>Only 0-1, 0-1 will not trigger a warning.</strong></p>
<h3 id="">*.*</h3>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/17.png'>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/18.png'>
<p>Similar to the binary *.* case, pay attention to renaming.</p>
<p>Various types of *.* will not generate warnings.</p>
<h2 id="Multiple-Relationships">Multiple Relationships</h2>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/1a.png'>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/1b.png'>
<p>Note that the cardinality must be n; participation does not have much effect on it.</p>
<p>If the cardinality is 1, there will be a warning:</p>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/1c.png'>
<h3 id="Four-Cases-of-Subclass-Merging">Four Cases of Subclass Merging</h3>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/21.png'>
<p>Let A be the parent class, and B and C be the subclasses.</p>
<h3 id="Enforce-Disjointness">Enforce Disjointness</h3>
<p>There is no need to create A; simply inherit the attributes of A to B and C.</p>
<h3 id="Optional-Disjointness">Optional Disjointness</h3>
<p>B and C cannot establish a connection with A (preserving the superclass-subclass relationship). Establish a connection between A and D; establish connections between B, C, and D, or connect each to other entities separately.</p>
<h3 id="Force-Non-Disjoint">Force Non-Disjoint</h3>
<p>Merge B and C first, then merge the result with A.</p>
<h3 id="Optional-Non-Disjoint">Optional Non-Disjoint</h3>
<p>Merge B and C, ensuring that B+C cannot establish a connection with A (while preserving the superclass-subclass relationship). Establish a connection between A and D, and connect B+C with D or other entities.</p>
<h2 id="Subclasses">Subclasses</h2>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/1d.png'>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/1e.png'>
<p>Subclasses inherit the attributes of the parent class. There is no difference among the four types of mandatory/overlapping relationships.</p>
<h2 id="Multivalued-Attributes">Multivalued Attributes</h2>

<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/20.png'>

<p>Create a new entity, a strong entity, separate the multivalued attributes, and establish a 1:* relationship with the original entity.</p>

<h2 id="First-make-a-set-of-assumptions-to-derive-relationships">First, make a set of assumptions to derive relationships</h2>
<ul>
<li>Employee ID corresponds to a unique name: ⑥ -&gt; ⑦</li>
<li>Property ID corresponds to a unique address: ① -&gt; ④</li>
<li>An employee can use only one car per day: ②⑥ -&gt; ⑧</li>
<li>A property can only be shown once per day: ①② -&gt; ③⑤⑥</li>

<h2 id="Removing-Dependencies">Removing Dependencies</h2>
<p>The last three lines can derive all information, so these three groups are <strong>candidate keys</strong>. At the same time, ①② is taken as the <strong>primary key</strong>.</p>
<p>①② → ④ and ① → ④, so ① → ④ is a <strong>partial dependency</strong>.</p>
<p>②③⑧ → ⑥ and ②③⑧ → ⑦, so ⑥ → ⑦ is a <strong>transitive dependency</strong> (also a partial dependency).</p>
<p>②⑥ → ⑧ is a <strong>dependency where the determinant is not a key</strong> (also a partial dependency).</p>
<h2 id="Exporting-the-Final-Table">Exporting the Final Table</h2>
<img src='https://img.junyu33.me/blog/database/combine5.png'>
<p>① and ④ form one table, ⑥ and ⑦ form another table, ②, ⑥, and ⑧ form a third table, and the remaining ①, ②, ③, ⑤, and ⑥ form a fourth table.</p>

<h3 id="Serialization">Serialization</h3>
<p>Conflicts may arise from <strong>read-write</strong> and <strong>write-write</strong> operations on the same transaction across different threads.</p>
<p>By treating each thread as a node and adding <strong>directed edges</strong> for <strong>read-write</strong> and <strong>write-write</strong> operations on the same transaction across different threads, if the generated graph is acyclic, it indicates that the parallel schedule is <strong>conflict</strong> serializable.</p>
<p><s>Scheduling for views belongs to the NP-complete problem and is unsolvable.</s></p>
<h3 id="Locking">Locking</h3>
<p>Read Lock / Shared Lock / <code>read_lock</code>: Allows reading by self and others, but prohibits writing by self and others.</p>
<p>Write Lock / Exclusive Lock / <code>write_lock</code>: Allows reading and writing by self, but prohibits reading and writing by others.</p>
<p>If someone else holds a shared lock, you can only acquire a shared lock; if someone else holds an exclusive lock, you cannot acquire any lock.</p>
<p>Two-phase locking can prevent issues such as <strong>lost updates, uncommitted dependencies, and inconsistent analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>Disadvantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cascading rollbacks</strong> — Solutions include releasing locks at the end of a transaction or releasing exclusive locks at the end of a transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Deadlocks</strong> — Solutions include lock timeout, wait-die &amp; wound-wait, and timestamp ordering.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Write Rule:</p>
<p>A writes first, then B reads; if A rolls back, the timestamp moves after B.</p>
<p>A writes first, then B writes; A's write is discarded.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ensure all locks are acquired before releasing any lock.</p>
