	<h1>Thirty-one - Miscellaneous Talks on &#34;Touhou Mystia Izakaya&#34;</h1>
	<p>Due to limitations of time and <s>financial resources</s>, I have only played the main game (I didn't bother with that computer either).</p>
<p>Version number: <code>2.2.9d</code> (BetaV86)</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h1>Brief Guide</h1>
<p>Rather than playing as a capitalist exploiting customers, I prefer to view Mystia's Izakaya as a nurturing game where you only need to focus on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Purchase the Night Sparrow set, memorize the highly-rated recipes for each rare guest, and ensure you have sufficient ingredients.</li>
<li>Familiarize yourself with keyboard controls and improve your speed to handle the challenges from Yuyuko and Youmu.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Powder-Review-Recipe-Remember-to-use-Night-Sparrow-Set">Powder Review Recipe (Remember to use Night Sparrow Set)</h2>
<p>Here are my habits, and there is more than one standard answer.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lily White</strong>: Pork + Egg + Honey + Cicada Shell = Pork Donburi, choose one from &quot;Yellow, Powder, Blue&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Chen</strong>: Eight-eyed Eel + Honey = Grilled Eight-eyed Eel, choose one from &quot;Yellow, Powder, Blue&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Rumia</strong>: Beef + Egg + Cicada Shell = Fried Cicada Shell, choose one from &quot;Yellow, Powder, Blue&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Keine Kamishirasawa</strong>: Tofu = Tofu Miso, Sun Moon Star.</li>
<li><strong>Hieda no Akyuu</strong>: Tofu = Tofu Miso, Sun Moon Star.</li>
<li><strong>Ibaraki Kasen</strong>: Flour + Radish = Dumplings, Sun Moon Star.</li>
<li><strong>Rinnosuke Morichika</strong>: Pork + Onion = Pork Donburi, Super Zun Beer.</li>
<li><strong>Reimu Hakurei</strong>: Pork + Honey = Grilled Pork Rice Ball, Winter Brew.</li>
<li><strong>Tenshi Hinanawi</strong>: Peach + Dew + Ice = Peach Blossom Soup, give any 400+ alcohol.</li>
<li><strong>Suika Ibuki</strong>: Wild Boar + Black Pork + Radish + Seaweed = Power Soup, Tengu Dance.</li>
<li><strong>Hong Meiling</strong>: Pork + Ginkgo Nut + Radish = ???, Scarlet Devil Mansion Coffee (?).</li>
<li><strong>Cirno</strong>: Cicada Shell + Ginkgo Nut + Honey = Fried Cicada Shell, Qi.</li>
<li><strong>Patchouli Knowledge</strong>: Phantom Epiphyllum + Dew = Phantom Epiphyllum Cake, Plum Wine.</li>
<li><strong>Fujiwara no Mokou</strong>: Pork + Tofu + Chili = Mapo Tofu, Qi.</li>
<li><strong>Kaguya Houraisan</strong>: Bamboo + Bamboo Shoot + Truffle + Black Pork + Ginkgo Nut = Princess Kaguya, Fourteenth Night.</li>
<li><strong>Inaba Tewi</strong>: Peach + Dew + Ice = Peach Blossom Soup, &quot;Yellow&quot;.</li>
<li><strong>Marisa Kirisame</strong>: Grilled Mushroom, &quot;Yellow&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Three-Trials">Three Trials</h2>
<p>Subject 1: Pure Speed. For the first wave, it's recommended to serve a cheap dish and green tea (since earning 1000 yen is relatively easy). For the second wave, serve Sparrow Sake, and for the third wave, serve carved cold dishes and Kazafuri. Bring all the corresponding cooking utensils for each wave to improve efficiency.</p>
<p>Subject 2: Rare customers give a lot of money (tips). As long as you <strong>always get pink remarks</strong>, it's quite easy to accumulate 5000 yen.</p>
<p>Subject 3: The first wave is a weaker version of Subject 1, so there's not much to say. The second wave requires activating 10 spell cards, with the focus on prioritizing Reimu, Kasen, and Mokou. Speed is essential (e.g., cooking multiple dishes simultaneously, making good use of pauses, etc.). The third wave in Story Mode has been significantly nerfed (the combo keeps dropping, but the remarks remain orange). Just keep feeding Energy Skewers and Qi. However, the third wave in the retake version of Subject 3 is somewhat challenging (regular customers order dishes not on the menu, black remarks/regular customers lose patience and use spell cards to destroy utensils). To improve efficiency, prepare dishes Yuyuko likes on different utensils, and make sure to have enough ingredients and drinks to avoid the awkward situation of being unable to serve regular customers.</p>
<h1>Some Fun Facts</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This game has a broad appeal. Whether it's me, my eight-year-old nephew, or my thirteen-year-old niece, everyone found it interesting (and none of them have been exposed to Touhou Project; one of them had never even played a game before). The latter two got into an argument over who gets to play the game, <s>and someone even jokingly offered to buy my computer at a high price</s>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This game can serve as a literacy test. For example, my nephew mispronounced these characters (his pronunciation is in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li>蝉蜕 (tuō)</li>
<li>天狗踊 (tǒng)</li>
<li>十六夜咲 (zèng) 夜</li>
</ul>
<p>Then my niece mispronounced these (her pronunciation is in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li>水獭 (lǎn) 祭</li>
</ul>
<p>And I mispronounced these (the correct pronunciation is in parentheses):</p>
<ul>
<li>稗 (bài) 田阿求</li>
<li>豆腐味噌 (cēng)</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are some questionable ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>藤原妹红 (I'm not sure if it should be read as hóng or gōng, but given its romaji <em>Huziwara no Mokou</em>, I lean toward the latter).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since my nephew found serving rare customers troublesome, he only opened his shop in Youkai Trail at night unless necessary. When Subject 3 required activating 10 spell cards, he only managed to activate one, and the final concert only featured Mystia and Kasodani Kyouko having fun by themselves (so I finally got to hear the normal concert BGM from my playlist that I had never heard before).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Story Mode Subject 2, worried that rare customers would slow down serving efficiency, I prepared two dishes that were universally suitable for both rare and regular customers (to avoid breaking the combo) and treated them equally. Unfortunately, the combo still broke, and I only managed to accumulate 5000 yen in the last half hour of the final wave, <s>thus achieving the feat of activating five spell cards in half an hour</s>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the error message when attempting to load a tampered game save, it can be inferred that the game is written in C#, so playing it on non-Windows platforms might take forever.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Bugs and Improvements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally, the screen flickers during gameplay in various colors, such as red, yellow, green, etc.</li>
<li>When Marisa activates a spell card, even if the animation is turned off, the frame rate drops significantly (less than 20fps on my computer).</li>
<li>A competitive mode could be added: <strong>clear all ingredients and drinks</strong> and set a fixed initial amount (e.g., 1000 yen), with all utensils, partners, and full rare customer's impression. Then compare the balance after opening the shop that night and include it in a leaderboard. <s>This would save the exhaustion of frantically clicking through the Ooedo Ship Festival and Jūya.</s></li>
</ul>
