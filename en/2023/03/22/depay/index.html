	<h1>How to buy ChatGPT Plus</h1>
	<p>Original URL: There were too many keywords, and the original author's server was under review, so I posted it on their behalf.</p>
<span id="more"></span>
<h1>ChatGPT Virtual Credit Card Binding</h1>
<h2 id="Registering-a-Depay-Virtual-Credit-Card">Registering a Depay Virtual Credit Card</h2>
<p>Download Depay on your phone using a US Apple ID, then register an account.</p>
<p>After registration, go to the account section (&quot;Me&quot; at the bottom) to complete your information and KYC verification. Select China as your country and fill in your real identity details. Follow the steps, and the review process will take a short while.</p>
<p>You also need to add a verification method under &quot;Security.&quot; It's best to use Google verification codes—scan the code with Authenticator. You'll need to verify with this mobile token every time a payment is involved.</p>
<p>Once all verifications are complete, you can add a virtual credit card. Go to the &quot;Card&quot; section at the bottom, click &quot;Apply Card,&quot; and apply for a Mastercard (not VISA). Choose the basic card with no creation fee.</p>
<p>Your virtual credit card will then be created.</p>
<p>Click on &quot;CVV&quot; to view detailed information, including the cardholder name, card number, expiration date, and CVV. All of these details will be needed when binding the card to OpenAI later.</p>
<h2 id="Buying-USDT-on-Binance">Buying USDT on Binance</h2>
<p>Go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.binance.com/">https://www.binance.com/</a> and click &quot;Continue with Google&quot; to log in.</p>
<p>After logging in, you need to complete <strong>Verification</strong>, which is a real-name authentication process.</p>
<p>For this step, select China as your Residency and enter your full name in Chinese.</p>
<p>Choose ID Card as the Document Type, which refers to the Chinese ID card.</p>
<p>For Document Verification, if your computer camera isn't convenient to use, you can download the app instead. You'll need a US Apple ID for this. When logging in with Google, a proxy is required, but for normal operations within the app, no proxy is needed.</p>
<p>Next, upload photos and complete facial verification. After submission, you should be verified shortly.</p>
<p>Once your identity is verified, you can purchase USDT directly in the mobile app. Go to the &quot;Trade&quot; tab (one of the four bottom tabs) → Buy Crypto → Search for USDT to make a purchase. The minimum payment per transaction is 100 RMB.</p>
<p>If you pay via Alipay, it may direct you to transfer money to a specific account. In this case, simply proceed with the transfer, provided the Alipay account is under your name.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you might receive a product link where each item costs 1 RMB. For example, if you want to buy 100 RMB worth of USDT, you'll need to place an order for 100 units of that product. When making the payment, include the provided name in the remarks. After successful payment, first confirm the order on Alipay, then notify the seller on Binance to release the coins and upload a screenshot of the order.</p>
<p>Regardless of the method, wait for the seller to confirm the transaction. Do not exit the page prematurely. Once you receive a confirmation message, the purchased amount will automatically appear, indicating a successful transaction.</p>
<h2 id="Transfer-to-Credit-Card">Transfer to Credit Card</h2>
<p>Due to Binance's security restrictions, a 24-hour waiting period is required after depositing funds before initiating a transfer. Therefore, after completing the steps above, you must wait one day before proceeding.</p>
<h3 id="Obtain-Recharge-Address">Obtain Recharge Address</h3>
<p>In the Depay app, select “Wallet” → USDT → Deposit → Choose Network, and select BNB Smart Chain (BEP20) (as this option has lower fees compared to the other).</p>
<p>Once you proceed, you will see a Recharge address. Copy it.</p>
<h3 id="Withdrawing-from-Binance">Withdrawing from Binance</h3>
<p>On the Binance app, select &quot;Portfolio&quot; → Withdraw → TetherUS. In the form labeled &quot;Send USDT,&quot; paste the address you just copied into the address field. Choose the same network as before, BNB Smart Chain (BEP20), enter the withdrawal amount, and proceed to withdraw &amp; confirm the order.</p>
<h2 id="Binding-a-Credit-Card-to-OpenAI">Binding a Credit Card to OpenAI</h2>
<p>First, prepare a real U.S. address, preferably from a tax-free state such as Alaska, Delaware, Montana, Oregon, etc. The address used for your U.S. Apple ID will work.</p>
<p>The zip code for the address should preferably be in the format xxxxx-xxxx, not just the first five digits.</p>
<p>Go to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview">https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/overview</a> and click &quot;Add Payment Method.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Make sure to enable a U.S. global proxy</strong></p>
<p>In the form:</p>
<ul>
<li>Copy and paste the cardholder name exactly as it appears.</li>
<li>Date - Use the two-digit month / last two digits of the year format.</li>
<li>CVC is the CVV shown in your Depay account.</li>
<li>For the credit card zip code, only enter the first five digits of the address zip code.</li>
<li>Country - United States of America</li>
<li>Address Line 1 - Copy the prepared address.</li>
<li>Address Line 2 - Leave blank.</li>
<li>City, State, Postal Code - Copy as is.</li>
</ul>
<p>Submit!</p>
<p>Successful!!!</p>
<h1>Using Apple In-App Purchase to Subscribe</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>An Apple device</li>
<li>U.S. address generator: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.meiguodizhi.com/usa-address/alaska">https://www.meiguodizhi.com/usa-address/alaska</a></li>
<li>Dual-currency credit card (optional)</li>

<p>Given the current demand for ChatGPT Plus subscriptions, many have struggled due to factors like IP restrictions, virtual credit cards, and too many failed attempts.</p>
<p>Today, I came across this article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/634920483">https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/634920483</a></p>

<p>I tried it and it worked! Compared to the method described in the article, this approach saves both time (no need to wait 24 hours) and money (lower handling fees). Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register a U.S. Apple ID; you can use a mainland Chinese phone number for verification.</li>
<li>Purchase a gift card on the Apple official website: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-giftcard/giftcard">https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-giftcard/giftcard</a> (You can also use Alipay to purchase without a credit card; I haven't tried this myself.)</li>
<li>Log into your App Store with your U.S. Apple ID and enter the gift card's PIN code to redeem it.</li>
<li>Download the OpenAI app. At this point, you may be asked to provide additional information such as first/last name, street address, phone number, etc. Just fill it in according to the details from the address generator. (It should generally work~)</li>
<li>If you don't have Shadowrocket, you'll need to spend an extra $3 to solve the VPN issue, meaning your gift card should have a value of at least $23.</li>
<li>Once that's resolved, log in, and you should have no issues subscribing to Plus. The Plus service works across both Apple devices and the web, including access to chat history.</li>
</ol>
<p><s>So, Apple is just amazing</s></p>
