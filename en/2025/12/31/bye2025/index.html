	<h1>Fifty-six——My 2025</h1>
	<p>I feel like my current life is like a PRNG lacking an entropy source, trapped in a loop called &quot;scientific research,&quot; but the one advantage is the rare sense of &quot;peace.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>ysyx's Phase C second defense was successfully passed, and I wrote a reflection on the Phase C project in the <a href="https://blog.junyu33.me/en/2033/05/13/nju_pa/">nju-pa article</a>. I probably won't be working on RTL design again in the near future.</li>
<li>Wrote a code generator and supported ARM/RISC-V for my graduation project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="二月">二月</h2>
<ul>
<li>I attempted to quit playing mahjong, but ultimately failed. It seems that playing cards has replaced rhythm games as an important way for me to relax and unwind.</li>
<li>While celebrating the Lunar New Year at my hometown, I upgraded my Honor phone to MagicOS 8.0 to fix the Play Integrity certification issue so I could renew my ChatGPT Plus subscription.</li>
<li>I set up the <a href="https://blog.junyu33.me/en/2025/02/27/overleaf/">Overleaf Community Edition</a> on my work computer and accessed it using a domain name.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="三月">三月</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read the elliptic curve section of <em>An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography</em>.</li>
<li>Read Antoine Joux's Gödel Prize-winning paper <em>A One Round Protocol for Tripartite Diffie–Hellman</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="四月">四月</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read the first chapter of <em>Washington</em>'s <em>Elliptic curves: number theory and cryptography</em>.</li>
<li>Read <em>Sutherland</em>'s <em>Sums of three cubes</em>，and wrote some <a href="https://blog.junyu33.me/en/2025/04/27/diophantine/">notes</a> combined with <em>Washington</em>'s content.</li>
<li>Wrote a <a href="https://blog.junyu33.me/en/2025/04/18/weil/">demo</a> for calculating the weil pairing.</li>

<li>Read the first five chapters of <em>Abstract Algebra: An Integrated Approach</em> by <em>Silverman</em>.</li>
<li>Reducing AI plagiarism in my graduation thesis using AI, and preparing for my thesis defense.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="六月">六月</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduated with a bachelor's degree. However, my graduation thesis did not receive an excellent grade due to formatting issues.</li>
<li>Expanded on the experiments from my graduation thesis and prepared to submit a paper to CHES 2026 Volume 1.</li>

<ul>
<li>Read Chapter 6 of <em>Silverman</em>'s <em>Abstract Algebra: An Integrated Approach</em>.</li>
<li>Read Chapter 2 of <em>Washington</em>'s <em>Elliptic curves: number theory and cryptography</em>. Understood why the point addition operation on <a href="https://blog.junyu33.me/en/2025/08/10/cayley/">elliptic curves satisfies the associative property</a>.</li>
<li>My first rebuttal, a reviewer said our work was a &quot;blatant restatement.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="九月">九月</h2>
<ul>
<li>Graduate school started. CHES 2026 submission rejected for the first time.</li>
<li>During a discussion with my advisor, I came up with a preliminary version of a logarithmic-depth reduction algorithm. I think it's quite elegant.</li>
<li>Started a weight-loss program.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="十月">十月</h2>
<ul>
<li>Read the first five chapters of Pan Chengbiao's &quot;Elementary Number Theory&quot; to fill in any gaps in my knowledge.</li>
<li>Spent 20 days expanding the 20-page CHES version of the paper to 30 pages for PKC.</li>
<li>The paper was submitted to PKC 2026 for the second time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="十一月">十一月</h2>
<ul>
<li>Reinstalled WSA on Windows 11 and successfully obtained strong integrity in the Play Integrity check. (Although after a while, the Play Store in WSA stopped working after an update, rendering the hack useless.)</li>

<li>Successfully lost weight, dropping from 73kg to 66kg.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="十二月">十二月</h2>
<ul>
<li>PKC 2026 submission rejected. This time there was no &quot;blatant restatement&quot;, but I likely encountered a maintainer from the gf2x library I was comparing against, who raised many technical questions and hinted that I should open-source my code.</li>
<li>Named the logarithmic-depth reduction algorithm Suwako, published it on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/2303.pdf">eprint</a>, and released the corresponding <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/junyu33/suwako">PoC</a>.</li>
<li>Obtained a one-year ChatGPT Plus membership with military verification for 40 RMB on Xianyu (a Chinese online marketplace), and immediately learned vibe coding.</li>
